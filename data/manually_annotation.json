Settlement and benefit estimates relate to your FDR program alone and do not represent the settlement or benefit estimates for any other customer. Amounts, time periods, benefits, and results are not guaranteed. Not all clients complete their FDR program. The accuracy of the estimates provided in this Debt Resolution Agreement depends on the accuracy and completeness of information we received from you and third parties. Actual amounts and time periods may be higher or lower than estimated and are subject to change. Program cost, settlements, and benefit estimates are based on prior results and will vary depending on your specific circumstances, your creditors\u2019 billing and collections practices, and your adherence to your FDR program requirements including making consistent deposits to your Dedicated Account. 1 These are estimates and are not actual amounts or periods. They are determined from information in your credit report and certain assumptions based on our prior experience and publicly available information on interest rates, charges and minimum payment requirements for consumer debt, such as, finance charges accrue at rates ranging from 6% to 29.99% (20.3% for current credit cards and 29.99% for delinquent credit cards). Your actual rates, charges, fees and minimum payment requirements may be higher or lower. These estimates also assume that there are no additional charges, rebates, refunds, payments or reductions of your debt other than the monthly payment of the estimated current total minimum monthly payment. 2 Estimated total settlement fees include settlement fees payable as described in Subsection 5.a. on all enrolled debts. These amounts exclude any other fees and charges (such as any state taxes, other costs and fees, and ", {"entities": []}], [" fees, if any, as described in Subsections 7.c and 3.b.vi.).\n3 Estimated ", {"entities": []}], [" service fees includes Monthly Service Fees charged by your Dedicated Account administrator, as described in Subsection 3.b.vi, over the estimated program length of your FDR program.

Debt resolution is suitable only for persons who are in financial distress and unable to pay or continue to pay their minimum monthly payments on their debts without severe hardship. Since many creditors will not consider an offer to settle a debt unless it is past due or charged off, our ability to negotiate settlements and reduce your enrolled debts depend on the delinquency status of the debt and you not charging, drawing or making advances on those debts. As a result, the use of debt resolution services will likely adversely affect your creditworthiness, may result in you being subject to collections or sued by creditors or debt collectors, and may increase the amount of money you owe due to the accrual of fees and interest. Your creditors may place the debt with third parties, such as collection agencies or law firms, to collect on the debt, and may sell the debt to another creditor or debt buyer. We cannot prevent a creditor, collector, or debt buyer from taking legal action, such as a lawsuit, against you and cannot provide you with any assurance that legal action will not be taken against you. Although you may have already fallen behind, or expect to fall behind, in making payments to your creditors due to your financial hardship, any decision to stop paying your creditors in connection with your enrollment in the FDR program is yours alone.\nNo Guarantee of Settlement; Limitation of Services. We do not guarantee that your debts will be settled at all, settled for a specified amount or percentage, or settled within a specified period of time. We do not assume your debts, and we do not make monthly, periodic, or regular payments on your debts. Not all Clients Complete the FDR Program. Not all clients complete the FDR program for various reasons, including the failure to deposit or maintain sufficient funds in their Dedicated Account. Timing of Negotiations and Settlements. Provided you make your scheduled deposits to your Dedicated Account, we expect to make a bona fide offer to settle your first debt within 3 months of your first program deposit. We expect that you will need to have accumulated as much as 25% of the amount due towards each new settlement (in addition to amounts needed to make payments on any ongoing settlements) in order for us to make a bona fide offer to settle each debt. These estimates are based on past results and do not apply in all circumstances. Settlement Fees. When we (or a representative) negotiate a settlement of a debt, which you authorize and such debt is fully resolved, we charge and are entitled to collect our settlement fee in an amount equal to Settlement Fee Percentage, as indicated on Section 5.a. of this Agreement, multiplied by the enrollment amount of that debt, as reflected on Exhibit A. Except as may be expressly provided under \u201cFDR Commitment\u2014Program Guarantee\u201d, each settlement fee, once earned, is non-refundable. Your agreement to each settlement constitutes your instruction to pay us the corresponding settlement fee from your Dedicated Account. You Own and Control your Dedicated Account. You will, at all times, own and control all funds held in your Dedicated Account. Only you can authorize a payment, transfer or withdrawal of funds from your Dedicated Account. Under no circumstances do we maintain custody or control your Dedicated Account or maintain custody or control the funds held in your Dedicated Account. You may withdraw from your FDR program at any time without penalty, and, if you do, you will receive all funds in your Dedicated Account, other than settlement fees earned by us. Termination. You may terminate this Agreement at any time, without any termination fee. Upon termination, you are entitled to receive the remaining funds in your Dedicated Account, other than earned settlement fees or fees earned by your ", {"entities": []}], [" processor, within seven (7) business days. You understand that if you terminate this Agreement, any agreed upon installment settlements may be adversely impacted, and you will be fully responsible for the full balance owed on any unsettled debts, including accumulated interest, fees, and deferred and/or unpaid earned settlement fees.\nBy signing this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and understand the potential consequences of enrolling in a debt resolution program, including but not limited to the potential consequences of failing to make payments on your debts and the potential impact to creditworthiness. um2-26e97g242564bd8/IA-20210506/MHF-20210503 Initials X [[ tab_client_initials X [[ ]] tab_co_client_initials Client Co-Client\nFreedom Debt Relief, LLC\nDebt Resolution Agreement\nThis Debt Resolution Agreement, along with each of the documents referenced in Subsection 7.f. entitled \u201cDocuments Incorporated by Reference\u201d (collectively the \u201cAgreement\u201d), is made by and between Freedom Debt Relief, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cFDR,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d), and <Your Info Here> <Your Info Here> and <Your Info Here> <Your Info Here> (\"you\" or \"your\"). This Agreement will not be effective until we receive from you a properly executed copy of each required document (\"Effective Date\").\n1. FDR Commitment.\na. Results First. You will not pay us any settlement fees until we reach a settlement. A \u201csettlement\u201d is the settlement, reduction, or other change to the terms of an enrolled debt. We will only charge you a settlement fee on an enrolled debt when a settlement is reached on that debt, you authorize the settlement, and at least one payment is made toward that settlement. See Subsection 5.a. below for a description of the timing of payment and amount of settlement fees.\nb. Program Guarantee. Our objective is to help you pay less than you currently owe on your enrolled debts over the life of your participation in the program. Accordingly, after you graduate from your FDR program or otherwise terminate this Agreement for any reason, we will evaluate your eligibility for a refund of some or all of the settlement fees you have paid. In particular, if your FDR program settlement costs exceed the enrolled amount of your settled debts then we will refund the amount of that excess, up to 100% of our settlement fees. Important notes and limitations: i. Your enrolled debts are reflected on Exhibit A and may be restated as described below. ii. For purposes of this settlement fee refund, your \u201cFDR program settlement costs\u201d are (a) the total amount you paid to your creditors through your FDR program, plus (b) the total settlement fees paid to us as described in Subsection 5.a. (excluding any other fees, costs or taxes you may incur). iii. In the event you charge, draw, or take advances on a debt after enrollment, that debt, and any FDR program settlement costs associated with that debt, will not be considered for purposes of this settlement fee refund. 2. Our Services. We will work in good faith to negotiate, either directly or with the assistance of agents, representatives, or attorneys (each, a \u201crepresentative\u201d), a settlement of each of the unsecured debts listed on Exhibit A (each, an \"enrolled debt\") during the term of your FDR program. As part of your FDR program, we will periodically provide you with access to financial educational materials designed to guide you through your FDR program and to help you better understand borrowing, spending and savings habits.\na. Negotiating Your Debt. We may negotiate, directly or through a representative, with a variety of different entities to settle your enrolled debts. These entities include the original creditor, the current creditor, or any other entity that may hold a debt, including any of their agents, attorneys, or third-party collectors (each, a \u201ccreditor entity\u201d). Placement or sale of a debt to a third party (such as a law firm, collection agency or debt buyer) does not mean the debt has been forgiven and does not mean that the debt is no longer due. The term \u201ccreditor\u201d means any and all creditor entities with which we may negotiate, directly or through our representative, a settlement of an enrolled debt.\nWhile we may expressly represent our ability to negotiate a settlement of an enrolled debt, we often negotiate settlements with creditor entities other than the original or current creditor. As a result, we make no representation about our ability to negotiate with any specific creditor entity and make no representation about whether any specific creditor entity will negotiate with us. If we do engage a representative, we will pay the cost, if any, for their assistance. By signing this Agreement, you consent to our requesting such assistance, and you acknowledge and agree to pay our settlement fee if such assistance leads to a settlement that you approve. b. Your Participation. In some instances, we may ask you to participate in negotiations with a creditor. Your participation may include you joining our negotiators or representatives in communications with a creditor or, possibly, you communicating with a creditor directly. You are not required to participate in such negotiations. If you choose not to participate, we will discuss alternative strategies for settling that debt. You may request that we continue attempts to resolve the debt without your participation. You may also withdraw that debt from your FDR program at any time before it is settled with no charge to you. If you withdraw a debt, we will continue our efforts to settle the other debts in your FDR program. If we do ask for your participation in negotiations with a creditor, and you agree to participate, we will advise you throughout the process, and you agree to pay our settlement fee, as described in Subsection 5.a. below, if a settlement is reached and you approve that settlement. um2-26e97g242564bd8/IA-20210506/MHF-20210503 Initials X [[ tab_client_initials X [[ ]] tab_co_client_initials Client Co-Client\nc.

Estimated Program Length. The estimated length of your program is indicated on the Program Details page of this Agreement, which is our estimate of the time it will take to settle all of your enrolled debts. The actual length of your program will depend upon (i) your ongoing ability to make your program deposits, as described below, and (ii) your creditors' willingness to settle your debts promptly and reasonably. Regardless of the estimated length of your program, we recommend that you make additional deposits to your Dedicated Account whenever possible. Additional deposits may help to settle your debts more quickly. The sooner you accumulate funds in your Dedicated Account, the sooner we can contact your creditors to negotiate settlements for you. 3. Your Responsibilities. Our ability to help you achieve your goals depends on you meeting your responsibilities under this Agreement. You agree to (i) make your scheduled program deposits to your Dedicated Account, on time and in full, and maintain sufficient funds in your Dedicated Account to make payments on your settlements, (ii) notify us promptly of any information or correspondence you receive from your creditors, including, but not limited to, any offer to settle a debt, any change in status of a debt, any notification of an assignment of a debt to a new servicer or creditor, and any lawsuits filed by your creditors, (iii) respond promptly to any request from us to approve a proposed settlement offer, (iv) assist us in verifying the information associated with any debt, including but not limited to account numbers, creditor identity, and amount owed on the Effective Date, (v) notify us of any change to your ", {"entities": []}], [" account information, telephone number, e-mail or physical address or other contact information, and (vi) respond promptly to our requests for documents.

Representations & Acknowledgements. By executing this Agreement, you represent to us, and acknowledge your understanding of, the following:\ni. Unsecured Debt Only. Each enrolled debt is an unsecured debt in the amount listed on Exhibit A, as may be restated as described in Section 5, and is your sole obligation and responsibility. You acknowledge that we do not assume or pay any debt or attempt to extend the time you may have to pay any creditor. If any of your enrolled debts are discovered to be secured by collateral, (1) you agree to hold us harmless for any negative consequences resulting from enrollment of the debt, (2) we may remove the debt from your FDR program, and (3) we will have no obligation under this Agreement to resolve the debt. um2-26e97g242564bd8/IA-20210506/MHF-20210503 Initials X [[ tab_client_initials X [[ ]] tab_co_client_initials Client Co-Client\nii. No Enrolled Debts Subject to Litigation No enrolled debt is subject to litigation at the time of enrollment into your FDR program. If any of your enrolled debts are discovered to have been subject to litigation prior to enrollment, (1) we may remove the debt from your debt resolution program, (2) we will have no obligation under this Agreement to resolve the debt, and (3) we are under no obligation to provide legal representation of any kind, including Limited Lawsuit Representation described clause (vii) below. For the purposes of this Agreement, \u201csubject to litigation\u201d includes, but is not limited to, a summons & complaint has been filed with a court of law, you have been served a lawsuit, there is a pending hearing or motion or required to appear in court, a judgment has been entered, or the creditor has garnished your wages, levied any ", {"entities": []}], [" accounts, or placed liens on any property or accounts you may have. iii. No Additional Charges; Additional Debt Not Covered by this Agreement. Any additional charges, draws, or advances on your enrolled debts you make after enrollment in your FDR program will impair our ability to secure settlement offers. Accordingly, you agree not to incur any further charges, make any further draws, or take any further advances on any enrolled debt after the Effective Date. Our obligations under this Agreement apply only to the debts listed on Exhibit A, as may be restated as described in Subsection 5.a., excluding any debts that have been removed as described below. See \u201cWithdrawal of Debts from the Program; Termination of this Agreement\u2014Our Right to Terminate this Agreement or Remove Debts\u201d for a description of our right to remove a debt or terminate your FDR program in the event you incur additional charges, draws or advances on any enrolled debt. In the event you incur additional charges, draws or advances on an enrolled debt and, notwithstanding our right to terminate or remove the debt, we still settle the debt for you, the fee refund described in \u201cFDR Commitment\u2014Program Guarantee\u201d will be calculated excluding the cost and fees for that debt.\niv. Certification of Financial Hardship. Debt resolution is not suitable for everyone. Our program is only suitable for persons who are unable to pay or continue to pay their minimum monthly payments to their creditors without severe financial hardship. By signing this Agreement, you are confirming that (a) you are in a verifiable state of financial hardship, (b) you are unable to pay or continue to pay your minimum monthly payments to your creditors, (c) you have considered other ways of dealing with your debt, including, for example, credit counseling or ", {"entities": []}], ["ruptcy, and (d) all financial information you have furnished to us is true, accurate, and complete. You may request information about other ways, such as ", {"entities": []}], ["ruptcy, to deal with your debts.\nv. Adverse Consequences. Prior to enrolling in the FDR program, you should carefully consider and understand the potential adverse consequences listed below and in \"Important Information\u2014Adverse Consequences\" above, and you should consider all of your options for managing your debts. If you do not make the minimum periodic payments on your debts, your delinquencies will likely be reported to consumer reporting agencies as late, delinquent, charged-off, or past due balances. Your creditor may also raise the interest rate on your debt and impose other penalties, such as late fees and over-limit fees. Until your account is charged off, your account balance may continue to grow as your creditor may add accrued interest and fees and penalties, and, if negotiations are unsuccessful, you could be called upon to pay the entire balance. Even if we are successful in negotiating a less than full balance resolution for you, your creditor may report to credit reporting agencies that the debt was settled for less than the full amount. In addition, an adverse change to your creditworthiness may adversely impact other non-enrolled debts or impair your ability to obtain financing or re-finance other debts. If you enroll a debt from a creditor with whom you have another account, the creditor may offset delinquent debts enrolled in your FDR program from other debts or accounts you have with that creditor. Enrollment of any debt may negatively affect other services from or loans you may have with that creditor, and that creditor may not offer you future services or products. If you are in the military, have a security clearance, or work for or are employed by a governmental agency, a negative impact to your credit may adversely affect your security clearance, military rank, pay, or current or future employment.\nIf you enrolled any debt that is or was used for business purposes, you or your business may be subject to collection methods or practices not protected by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Your enrollment of a business debt may affect other business or personal credit you may have or seek. In addition, any debt that is or was used for business purposes may not be eligible for law firm or attorney representation described in\n\u201cLimited Lawsuit Representation\u201d below.\nIf you enroll a debt that has a co-borrower who has not signed this agreement as a co-applicant, the co- borrower may be subjected to the same adverse consequences you may face, including, but not limited to, an adverse impact to their creditworthiness, collection activities, and potential litigation. A non-enrolled co- borrower does not have any rights to your FDR program, and our obligations under this Agreement do not um2-26e97g242564bd8/IA-20210506/MHF-20210503 Initials X [[ tab_client_initials X [[ ]] tab_co_client_initials Client Co-Client\napply to any non-enrolled co-borrower. You agree to hold us harmless for any negative consequences resulting from the enrollment of a debt that has a co-borrower who has not signed this Agreement as a co- applicant.\nBy signing this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and understand the potential consequences of enrolling in a debt resolution program. vi. Limited Lawsuit Representation. We cannot prevent a creditor, collector or debt buyer from suing you or taking other legal action against you. If you are sued on an enrolled debt, we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, engage a Legal Partner Network law firm or attorney (\u201cLPN\u201d) to represent you in connection with that suit. There is no assurance that you will receive such representation. Any such representation will be limited and focused on addressing the lawsuit by settling the debt with the creditor. In order to be eligible for LPN representation you must complete all scheduled program deposits to your Dedicated Account on time and in full, and you must sign the Lawsuit Representation Agreement attached as Exhibit F. If you receive LPN representation, we will pay the cost of such representation and will not charge you additional fees for such representation; however, you agree to pay any court costs or similar fees, and we will charge our settlement fee described in Subsection 5.a. if a settlement is reached in connection with such LPN representation, you approve that settlement, and a payment is made towards that settlement. LPN law firms and attorneys are not FDR employees, and FDR does not own or control any of the law firms or attorneys that are engaged for LPN representation. FDR is not a law firm and FDR agents and employees are not attorneys and cannot and do not provide legal advice or legal guidance. LPN law firms and attorneys are deemed to be \u201crepresentatives\u201d for purposes of negotiating your debt as described in Section 2 above. If a debt is removed from your FDR program or this Agreement is terminated for any reason, LPN representation, including our obligation to cover the cost of such representation, will immediately terminate with respect to each affected debt.\nvii. Tax Consequences. If a creditor cancels $600 or more of a debt, the creditor may report to the Internal Revenue Service that you received discharge of indebtedness income. This means that if we settle a debt for less than the amount due on that debt, you may be required to pay taxes on the difference between the amount you owe and the amount you pay under a settlement. You may also be required to pay taxes on the full amount of a debt if the creditor writes off the full amount of the debt and you pay nothing to the creditor. Since we are not tax professionals and cannot give you tax advice, we recommend that you contact a tax professional to discuss the potential tax consequences of a resolution of a debt for less than the full balance. c.
